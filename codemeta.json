    "name": "3TST - A Steiner Tree Heuristic",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "description": "3-Terminal Steiner Tree (3TST) is a heuristic for the Steiner tree problem. Intuitively, the heuristic works by replacing 3-terminal subtrees of a prospective solution with lighter 3-terminal subtrees. This process is repeated until no significant improvement is observed in a reasonable amount of time.",
